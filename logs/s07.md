Koch curve- figured out turtle doesn't work well in ipynb
Tested it at depth 2, 4

.ipynb files (Jupyter notebooks) are JSON files that contain a mix of code cells, markdown text, and saved outputs. 

Library compatibility — things like turtle, tkinter, and anything that opens a GUI window won't work properly in notebooks. They expect a standalone Python process with access to the display. Notebooks run through a web-based kernel that can't handle that.
Output — notebooks can render rich output inline (plots, HTML, images, DataFrames). A .py file just prints to the terminal unless you explicitly open a window or save to a file.
